# Whoa Next

A static site about random interesting things built with Next.js and Markdown. Deployed with GitHub Actions and Pages.

## Goals of the project

-   Experiment with:
    -   Next.js
    -   Converting Markdown to HTML
    -   Static sites
    -   GitHub actions. Used to build the static HTML pages on commit to `main` on the GitHub pages branch hosted at [https://philyawj.github.io/whoa-next](https://philyawj.github.io/whoa-next)
-   Focus on functionality and not design. Skeleton CSS with very minimal styling.
-   Three posts in two categories. Enough to show that categories work.
-   Convert to Typescript.

## Running locally
